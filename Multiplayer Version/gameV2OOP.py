This is an OOP designed game. We have two classes: a Server class and a Client class. Ideally, we have one server and two clients connected to it.
The server keep tracks of the whole game and all the game logic and the board and everything. In the client class, it
has an instance variable which is its ID to distinguish between player 1 and player 2. Each client connected is an instance of the
Client class/an object. The server keeps track of turns and all the client really does is send the move to the server socket object
while the server sends the board back to each client and each client prints it. Make sure the board is owned by the Server object.
Here's the main flow of how run_game() in this version should look: create Server object and socket, for each new connection to the socket,
create a Client object, so now we have 1 Server socket and 2 Client sockets. Server sends all clients the empty board and all clients print that
empty board along with the intro welcome message. Then, All clients prompt users
for the names, and the clients send the names to the server which adds those names to a list it now owns of the player names.
Now, in the main run function, it keeps track of the turn count (i) for alternating turns
and in the while loop, run the get_winner() server instance method and is_board_full() server instance method
on the server instance board, and follow the standard procedure for that with all the messages and stuff and break if there's
a winner or if the board is full, and then move onto the main part, where the client who's ID % 2 == Turn % 2 asks user for the move
and it goes through that whole list and stuff from the main.py in Game with AI Folder in Tic-Tac-Toe Folder under Projects under Python in the Flashdrive.

You don't really need threading for this honestly because put simply and following KISS logic, just make it simple in a single thread.

'''
Use Python's pickle module to send objects. Here's the basics:
d = {1: "Hey", 2 : "There"}
msg = pickle.dumps(d) # this pickles it
print(msg) # this prints msg in bytes serialization format, so you don't even need to do encode or decode cause it's already a bytes object

on the other side
d = pickle.loads(msg)
print(d)
